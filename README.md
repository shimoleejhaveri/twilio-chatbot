# BookBot
BookBot is a simple chatbot trained to provide the user with a recommendation for the next book to read. The chatbot was trained with samples using Twilio's in-built NLP engine. The back-end is built in Python using Flask as the web framework.

## Version 2.0
The goal is to try and build tasks and train them using samples without using the Autopilot console.
